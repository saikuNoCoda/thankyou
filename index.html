        <p>Theory of Computation and Graph Theory were two very interesting courses. It would not be an understatement to to say your teaching inspired me to learn more about Theoretical Computer Science. Thank you very much sir. I deeply cherish the conversation we had about higher studies and the life of an academic researcher. You are an inspiration! Thanks again! </p>

        <p>A professor because of whom we used to eat biscuits during tests, drink juices during tests, actually enjoyed tests and mainly with whom we had some nice conversations. He used to be funny, always had a nice story, wanted to know about the students and cared about all of us. A down-to-earth person with a very lovely personality, a nice bicycle stride and a black umbrella too big for him. I am lucky to know you and spend some time with you.
          <br>PS: He was a preety darn good proffesor as well :)</p>

        <p>Dear sir,
          I want to thank you for all that you have done for me over the past few years. I've learned a lot from you, I always waited eagerly for your classes and tutorials. My love for CS is because of the courses you taught me so well. I was blessed to have a friendly and helpful mentor like you. I wish we could have met you before leaving college, but I'm sure all of us will return someday or the other and meet you again :) 
          <br>
          Until then, take care.
          Thank you for everything!
          <br>
          Regards,DD</p>

        <p>You have been the best example of how a degree college professor should be. Calm, cool, collected, your unorthodox methods of teaching had always been the best for us. And just seeing you all excited and enthusiastic about the topics you teach us such an uplifting for our moods.

          Thank you for coming into our lives and making it a lot better than what it would have been. And please change your profile pic in the NITK website ðŸ˜‚</p>

        <p>Dear Sir,
          I really appreciate effort you put in your teaching. I always look forward to your classes because  of brainstorming and fun we do. Your are the one of the few teachers who makes student feel the beauty of subject by making us approach  the questions by our own. You always make students comfortable in classes by your friendly nature , giving us room to do mistakes and then analyse and correct them. It makes learning so much enjoyable. Thank you for your teaching.</p>
