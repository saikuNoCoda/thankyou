        <p>Theory of Computation and Graph Theory were two very interesting courses. It would not be an understatement to to say your teaching inspired me to learn more about Theoretical Computer Science. Thank you very much sir. I deeply cherish the conversation we had about higher studies and the life of an academic researcher. You are an inspiration! Thanks again! </p>

        <p>Dear Manu sir, you are the best prof I met in CS dept. I never enjoyed any theory course except Theory of Computation and Graph Theory. The reason is the way you taught. It was so fun attending your classes and tutorials. You were always friendly and kept us inspiring to learn. From your first guidance at MB to Major project, the journey was so fun. You always cared more about us, our well being, our efforts than the final result, and this makes you so different than other profs. We are so fortunate to have a great prof like you. Hope to meet you very soon. Thanks for guiding us and being a great friendly mentor.</p>

        <p>Dear Sir, 
          You were the one teacher, over all the years, who left an impression on me. You were the best, and I appreciate it so much. You were easily available when we needed you. Your words were always motivating and inspiring.
          Honestly, I didn't have any interest in the Graph Theory course, when I took it. I simply took it cause I didn't have any other choice. But the way you taught it, it made me love GT and it was subject where I learnt the most. 
          Apart from being a wonderful teacher, you are a great human being. You are kind, humble and caring. Thank you for that too.</p>

        <p>A professor because of whom we used to eat biscuits during tests, drink juices during tests, actually enjoyed tests and mainly with whom we had some nice conversations. He used to be funny, always had a nice story, wanted to know about the students and cared about all of us. A down-to-earth person with a very lovely personality, a nice bicycle stride and a black umbrella too big for him. I am lucky to know you and spend some time with you.
          <br>PS: He was a preety darn good proffesor as well :)</p>

        <p>The best professor I have known, hands down. Every class would have fruitful discussions and a variety of proofs coming up, I used to wait to wait for your classes all the time, and wanted as many courses of yours as possible. The 2 hour lectures used to seem shorter than a 1 hour lecture in any other subject. 
          <br>
          You are one of the most approachable professors I know. I can never forget all the conversations we had about ICPC, Major Project, electives and courses offered by the department, placements, academics, corona situation in different cities, how life is in general and many more :) it was always like talking to a friend more than a professor. I thank you for everything, and hope to see you soon!</p>

        <p>Dear sir,
          I want to thank you for all that you have done for me over the past few years. I've learned a lot from you, I always waited eagerly for your classes and tutorials. My love for CS is because of the courses you taught me so well. I was blessed to have a friendly and helpful mentor like you. I wish we could have met you before leaving college, but I'm sure all of us will return someday or the other and meet you again :) 
          <br>
          Until then, take care.
          Thank you for everything!

        <p>You have been the best example of how a degree college professor should be. Calm, cool, collected, your unorthodox methods of teaching had always been the best for us. And just seeing you all excited and enthusiastic about the topics you teach us such an uplifting for our moods.

          Thank you for coming into our lives and making it a lot better than what it would have been. And please change your profile pic in the NITK website ðŸ˜‚</p>

        <p>Definitely, I am not the intelligent/hardworking student whom you have met, but your presence makes me to work a little harder than I thought of doing :P. You are the best teacher. You always motivated us to try our level best. You teach by your heart and that's what makes you different from others. You are more of a friend than a teacher for all of us. 
          <br>P.S. - Can never forget day long exams, biscuits and juices during our midsems and endsems :)</p>

        <p>Dear Sir,
          I really appreciate effort you put in your teaching. I always look forward to your classes because  of brainstorming and fun we do. Your are the one of the few teachers who makes student feel the beauty of subject by making us approach  the questions by our own. You always make students comfortable in classes by your friendly nature , giving us room to do mistakes and then analyse and correct them. It makes learning so much enjoyable. Thank you for your teaching.</p>

      Thanks a lot guys for making the class enjoyable. There is just one teacher but lot more students in a class. It's the students who make the class what it is. You guys were awesome. Each one is different and I was extremely happy listening to your ideas.  I have never felt any day that the class is boring. You guys have kept it lively. In every class I have been much more happier after the class than before I entered it. I also have learnt a lot.  Not many get an opportunity to listen to such brilliant and variety of thoughts from young minds. What more can you ask for in your job. I have enjoyed every class and the reason is students... Thanks for adding one more dimension of enjoyment in my life. Do whatever you like with joy.. Live, learn, enjoy... ðŸ™‚
